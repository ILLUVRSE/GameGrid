# Testing PixelBrawl v0.1

## Knockback Tuning Test
1. Start a match with two players.
2. With Player 1, land a neutral attack on Player 2.
3. Observe launch distance at the following target damage values:
   - **0%**: short hop/slide.
   - **50%**: medium launch.
   - **150%**: strong launch (near KO).
4. Repeat with other moves to validate tuning consistency.

Tip: Use the debug overlay (Menu → toggle Debug) to confirm hitbox placement and collision timing.
